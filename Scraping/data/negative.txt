I'm bearish short term but bullish long term ü§îüòÖ
is a useless chain. Don't waste your time and money in such ghost project
is dead .. $HBAR  will be #1
is LAME! WARNING DO NOT BUY ANYTHING RELATED TO ADA. Sundae or min SWAP especially! I AM IN A TRAP! DO NOT BUY ANYTHING RELATED to ADA EVER!
its funny how some people thought this trash would never get under $2 i sold mine at 3 i got tired of watching it go no where.
KNC moon, this in shit :
LUNA is a dead scam coin that scammed a bunch of useless Luna maxi got rugged bc they thought $LUNA is a "investment" I'm glad they lost everything. they deserve it. now go buy the real projects like $ADA $BTC $ETH $XRP buy these coins and hold and stake. ETH bridge to ADA NFT
LUNA this project can't be revived, deal with it and be save
Poor tokenomics, Charles refuses to burn tokens because the majority of the community doesn't understand how the burn process works. they just added more coins to the mainnet.  One of the worst performing coins of the Last bull run.
Stand whith $BTC $ETH $DOGE $SHIB $BNB $XRP $ADA $MATIC $LTC
starting to lose faith in ADA it just doesn't deliver or hold up its price like ETH, SOL, or FTM. Still waiiiiiiiiiiiting for it to pop. Even when everything else was making crazy highs, it barely pumped.
the shitcoin of shitcoins. Should have NEVER listened to anyone recommending that.
This coin keeps disappointing.
this is a dead crypto that didn't even work when it was alive all hype no performance can't scale not secure the only thing it's good for is making the rich richer and retail investors poor
trash. held for 1 year. kept buying the DIP and avg down. still losing money. finally got rid of this shit.
will go back to .03 again
will go down further
zero value soon, see half year graph
zero zero! with all stupid holders :
back to last year dip 12
dont get tempted by the pump you will regret buying at this price, wait for next 2 - 3 months to bottom then buy
I read that LFG bought 100 million dollars worth. I would worry they dump it to revive the UDT ecosystem or LUNA. They are not tie together but they are invested in each other, you can read yourself on Do Kwon twitter on 4/7/22.
Ill buy when it gets to $0.0001
like luna, avax can also be RESET .. spot .. liq ..
LUNA  Bitconnect ver2. Don't trust this clown again guys. The crypto world needs to be build on solidated projects such $DOT
Luna will pull avax with it.
next LUNA for sure
nobody uses this! Go to Defi Lama and see for yourself.  Dead coin. Sell immediately!
price are hot but currently it's bearish, it's not fair, why investors are not buyiing it?
same fate as Luna
Sell now. It's heading to next support sub $8-$9. It's a long bear market.
will likely touch $10-$12 in the next 2-4 months before markets starts it‚Äôs recovered. Easy 10-20x after that
Another LUNA .. BNB to collapse soon
Avoid obscure and tricky projects
binance crashed UST.   to strengthen bnb stable
bounce on the support
is gonna be taken over by $CRO
LUNA this project can't be revived, deal with it and be save

- getting bearish on day to day cycle! -_-
$8k is the ultimate bottom. No sense buying before then.
$ETH $SOL all cryptos follow Bitcoin sadly‚Ä¶.
‚ÄúThe whales‚Äù don‚Äôt need the high price for crypto because a lot of people will go out from crypto but ‚Äúwhales‚Äù need to sell you some crypto every day to get your fiat & solve their problems.They doing ‚Äúbest‚Äù price not to let you go out.Save u money.
all crypto is just one big ponzi scheme.
Be aware, just look at monthly TF and nothing, Full Body RED Candle
BEARMARKET IS REAL SELL NOW OR SUFFER 10K INCOMING!!
Brace yourselves for the permanent Cryptocurrency blanket ban all over the world. This sh*t got destroyed when institutions like Goldman Sachs etc stepped in.
can the dip just happen already so we can move on and start a bull market. This bear market is getting very tiresome. üôÉ
channel used by some to promote all kind of shitcoins and scam projects. Rest assured that if someone has discovered a little üíé on crypto will not be bragging about it here. I wouldn‚Äôt. Would you?üßê
chart looks similar to may16th, big drop today to 26k
Davos/IMF pushing for world wide CBDC. BTC will be outlawed.
didn‚Äôt go any higher than 31,300 the past 10 days. Will be stuck in 20ies ‚Ä¶ $22,222 target
Do Kwon smarter than all of us, he sold all of BTC and ran...
I belive BTC will go down first to 19 thsd and next step to under 10 thsd. thank God I have no
I shouldn't have bought it.
I think Bitcoin will fall to 27000 and then to 17000
I think BTC will still massively fall despite the fact that it‚Äôs growing on a slow rate.
is not better than LOCKPAY
it will down gaian to 27k
LUNA is a dead scam coin that scammed a bunch of useless Luna maxi got rugged bc they thought $LUNA is a "investment" I'm glad they lost everything. they deserve it. now go buy the real projects like $ADA $BTC $ETH $XRP buy these coins and hold and stake. ETH bridge to ADA NFT
needs more drops , too early for a temporary rise. Already in its 20ies.
prices in June will wait for July and buy at the end of June !!!
target august, and then ath
the best way to lose ur life savings
They are already have eaten half of your money & need more BTC victims.Don‚Äôt believe fake high prices for ‚Äúnothing‚Äù.Use professional analytics & save your money from crypto.Be smart & clever üôè

8 cent stable coin. Need I say more?

BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $XRP  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE   $DOT  $SHIB  WOW. The market seems to spike up for only a few moments only to crash down immediately. Who would have known? #FeedingTime  #BearMarket
buying when it comes back to 0.004
elon musk has abandoned this coin
get into a coin w use case so you can finally get that good night sleep you‚Äôve been missing!  The answer is Kadena.  Kaddex launching soon.
i thing it will not increse for now
is almost dead, cause nobody sees value there :(
is an 8 cent stable coin
isn‚Äôt growing it‚Äôs shit
It's a meme coin bro
its literally a meme coin , gamble all you want but don‚Äôt complain if you loose
Losing holders. The dream is over.
LUNA  Sell your Luna if you bought the dip and invest in other coins and token. You can still make decent profit and recover some loss. Invest in $RVN  $LINK  $SOL  $ATOM  $ETH  $DOGE  Before Bull Ramp up.
LUNA this project can't be revived, deal with it and be save
Since Twitter going down Elon will most likely stop supporting dogecoin lol.
They USE FOMO to take our money from deluded get rich media stories.
why can't it also be stable as the dollar as a means of payment
will go back to .002
according to my TA this is going to $2.  Sell now and buy back later w dry powder.
at the bear market peak we can expect to see 2 dollar DOT.  Sell immediately!
BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $XRP  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE   $DOT  $SHIB  WOW. The market seems to spike up for only a few moments only to crash down immediately. Who would have known? #FeedingTime  #BearMarket
DOT don't have limited supply, so for me is no good to invest in, because if they want, they can print more DOT and the value goes down.
excitement and hype long gone.  Get out now
it‚Äôs still the sellers for me.
It's amezing project and it's founder, don't buy now... wait for its price 1$. it will 1$ before bull run.
LUNA  Bitconnect ver2. Don't trust this clown again guys. The crypto world needs to be build on solidated projects such $DOT  $AVAX
morale in the community very low and the hype is long gone.  Sell it!
no tokens on this
sold out of $DOT  for more $STX
this project is the future, but if you look closely  you can see that it will first drop lower and lower.. according to my analise it will drop to around 6 maybe 5 dollars
will go down to $3
$BTC $SOL now starts the domino effect
According to the graph and the estimates for ETH they look very bad, it seems that soon another crypto will take its place and this one will leave the top 5, remember that your active CEO has lost a lot of money and bankruptcy speculation is huge !!!

BTC $ETH $WAVES $DOGE  Why millions of different kind of coins? if btc claims an hedge against dollar and feedom from traditional banks.
burning eth has only taken away from the miners profits and has done NOTHING for its price!
Defintely headed for a 1k.
fake pump dont fall for it
I am more worried than ever about USDT depegging off 1 dollar and after that we might need a year or two just to get back to current levels
I have a feeling we are going to see some more down side till we get the upside
is Bullshit, it will dissolve to nothing like every other shitcoin
is going for a major correction. Prepare for $1.5K ETH in the next 7 days. Though long term(years) I'm still bullish.
losing ground at double speed compared to $BTC  . For me not surprising at all. Got my popcorn, watching this drama unfolding...
LUNA  Sell your Luna if you bought the dip and invest in other coins and token. You can still make decent profit and recover some loss. Invest in $RVN  $LINK  $SOL  $ATOM  $ETH  $DOGE  Before Bull Ramp up.

this is overrated. Actual price is around 100
we going down downnnn. sooner or later but eventually we going down
WE ON A RECESSION!!
why can't it also be stable as the dollar as a means of payment
why eth when u can go hbar.
Will ethereum die?  Because there are 7 red candles, what will ethereum do next?  Or do they want to be like Luna?
will get killed by $PLS
1 week go earth...$luna go dead today
Binance has offered the companies that were built on the LUNA chain a new home on the bnb chain. this is not good news for LUNA. But the companies that were built on the LUNA chain can save themselves.
buy any cryptocurrency just not Luna let's make a point that we are not going to put up with being scammed
can someone please explain me what is the IQ of all you which invested in this crap? Lower than the average temperature in Siberia?
Dead is dead and it is finished
do you believe can revive ? I said no
don't get sucked into the Luna black hole. you can't get out once you're sucked in.
Funny...  Families lost all your savings into this project, and people still believe that it will reach $1. The CEO laughed at the fall of the project.   Do not fall for "rumors". Pick a proper project with a good fundament and hodl. Luna proved that isn't trustful.
hahaha imagine trusting these clowns with a V2 to do it all over again! Goodbye to algorithmic. Let's stick to the stuff actually backed by USD.
I heard need to sell all Luna
I hope this project dies completly soon
I invest 5 months ago 3500‚Ç¨
I lose a lot whit this coin
I think if you wanted to make a profit, you had to buy at 0.00001675 and sell at 0.006. It's hard to accept that but you have to be realistic and move on.
I was telling all of you sheeps about real value of #luna ponzi shitcoin, but you kept throwing money out of the window
If we break 0.0001 resistence its over... we go to 0.00001
Incoming correction. UST took another hit.
is a dead project, tokens are not burned, but new ones are minted
is a trap
it‚Äôs going down day by day
know I have some cent in my wallet
kwon burn your 45% supply
kwon says you only losing tokens burning does nothing?
let's all boycott Luna
Nice pump again, then rugpull..
no disaster in the world cost as much as Luna cost the crypto market
pumped to dumpster
read Red dit article: After part 1, PART 2: The Rabbit-hole That Lead To Do Kwon's Missing 80K(90K) Bitcoin
say no more Luna
That's my situation: filling my bags with Luna (classic) and waiting for the fork (plus I'm not going to buy not even a single new Luna). Moreover, I was thinking about a way to burn luna (maybe an NFT collection just like Shib???).
The last slice of LUNA cheese is sliding slowly off the edge of the biscuit. üßÄ
The USDT-LUNA market will be removed on 06/03/2022. at bittrex  who have luna there sell and run .
They pump it like that so people invest, then they rugpull...
this is binance fault why did relisted luna
This is the reason entire Crypto  dustry will get tightly regulated much sooner than anticipated here in the US. much needed also. Regulation= no rug pulls.
THIS WILL FAIL A LOT BOYS
today another 200 bilion luna were printed. watch the supply in blockexplorer. that thing will have more coins than shiband and doge together at the end of the month.
UNLOCKED WALLET HOLDS 49,17% OF LIQUIDITY ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è DEAD PROJECT ‚ö†Ô∏è
We are in a bear market that we probably won‚Äôt see again for a while, there is so many opportunities out there and everyone of you are going to miss the boat over a dead coin.
Why let us continue to buy LUNA to defend the peg? Absorbing the cost. Saying ‚Äúthere is no way around it‚Äù, ‚Äúgetting close, stay strong‚Äù and ‚Äúdeploying more capital‚Äù. I bought pre-attack and after all the way down.
as soon as input all my money in i hear about this hack

BTC $ETH $SOL all cryptos follow Bitcoin sadly‚Ä¶.
bullish long term but the worst is yet to come.
Definitely headed for 10 bucks.
down to $10 soon
dropping revenue and transactions amounts. fifteen bucks is a good buy
Dropping to $40 in the next 7 hours
ETH $BTC $SOL now starts the domino effect
everything will go back to where it started don't be fool all market been droping for the last 6 month anything you put will lose and you will end up dca forever and lose your money
How do people trust this chain for real??!
i bought at 95$, porcoddio
idk I think its gonna stay at the same price for a bit
if SOL going down beyond dogecoin, 5 billions to go, well thats embarrasing but not so surprising for such a broken network
I'm no expert, but I believe SOLANA will drop between $19-$26 in the near future! Invest what you can afford to lose, but it will eventually go back up!
is not good now
maybe, just maybe the team behind this project solve all problems, but centralization (maybe some day). But I think now is overvaluated (just an opinion).
My price prediction is $10 by end of year. Time to short it.
next luna down
price is just a hype. A chain with a lot of stops and scaling problem only worth less than $5. Just be careful!
same as $LUNA just a few days
the real price in my vision is 24 to 36
The Winter has come... Sol will touch all time high in 2025
this coin had its day & will prob be the next Luna and dump hard.  Reposition yourself w a lower cap coin that can actually make you some money for once.
This coin sol does not maximize supply, be careful cases like Luna which increase supply,this can occur in all projects that have no supply limit, love your money
Ugly weekly chart like the Nasdaq chart #cryptocrash  #technicalanalysis
why always got down
will be dropping, alot of bearish confirmation. Opportunity for smart investors to buy low.
will be the next Luna. Just saying
will bounce back but bearish for now
will break down strongly
will go down by the end of the year to .50
fishy business. dyor and you will see
is next Luna. ponzi
is the next $LUNA  Be prepared!
is the next LUNA
It's Luna all over again
next luna , remember my words
shit coin..unlimited supply
short tron, ponzi like luna
the next pyramid, pamp and damp 100% like LUNA did
Throw out your TRX, keep safety of funds
trx will die soon
will have a similar downfall to Luna. look how fast it shot up to to top 20 coins, I‚Äôm shorting the hell out of this
will It pump before crashing like luna? or Just crash?
Avoid obscure and tricky projects
banker coin. bin it.
bigger dump coming

Gary Gensler statement today confirms that SEC have this case won. This security is heading to zero unfortunately.
i cant even buy this and everytime i try it dont work.
If you want to see where we're going with XRP, have a look at its index between June 2018 to November 2020. It will be a long and boring flat unless BTC starts its bullrun soon.
I'm very Bearish
keep dreaming of $1000 when it can't even reach it 2018 ath lol. ponzinomic just like terra

Crap ADA ready for 9th place
dont buy this beautyful piece of s***. Buy $CADINU
Economists want to stop the misuse of bitcoin & maximize profits. But there are powers & other interest who only want to stop it.   Paying your taxes with Bitcoin may one day be a reality, the internet of things & the dark net interconnect us with technology.
highly speculative project, promises a lot but nothing done. The founder has a huge ego, we have better projects on the market. 
how are my bagholders are doing today? charles have gone on vacation in Africa while you struggle (instead of upgrading cardano as he promised)...any problem with that??
I am bearish on 
I feel sorry for all the people that are still holding ADA. 
looking toward next bull run which will took its price to 5$ 
lost a lot of money because of this shitcoin
my favorite joke : $ADA holders lmao. 
The second most dead Coin ever. Just behind the  Crypto village accelerator
This is such a notable and uncommon project!
USDT MC droping one Billion per week more peolple are fleeing, can Tether redeem all the 65 Billions, only time will tell $BTC $ETH $BNB $SOL $ADA 
zoom out to the one year people should have sold in December 
120 % increase in supply from start of 2021 ( 120 mill) until now 290 mill‚Ä¶ that is one of the most inflammatory coin ever !
Bscscan shows us, that we are still in a downtrend :( I expected still a 20-25% drop on all cryptos $BTC $ETH $BNB $XRP $ADA $SOL $DOGE $SHIB $AVAX $MATIC 
going down, down, down. $10.
is awesome and great buy level soon. Don't sleep on serenitycapital.co  though, up 90% today alone.
Lil bro said rip in advance 
The price will be paid one day for separating from the central authorities. The banks, global financial powers & whoever else can afford to be.   Has Bitcoin been tainted by SilkRoad & money laundering schemes? Or will the power of cash & cc's come under the same scrutiny?
this coin will dissapear for sure....centralized...stick to ada
will dissapear soon, stick to ada
is a ponzi coin with no utility tied to a shady crypto exchange. I'd never touch this with a 10ft pole

9.1% the inflection rate for July
Almost a month ago a crash from 30k to 20k. Whole month it is dancing between 18k and 22k. Be prepared for new crash this month
and other altcoins will go much lower this month. inflation rates probably 10% and if they show 100 basis points  this will set a recession mood and the sentiment  is  gona make this market to tank after the 13th of July.
are we on bottom or we hit for 10k $USD ?
AUG-SEPT 10K!  Be Patient
bear market just started be careful boys
Bitcoin will establish a new world order. But before the old criminal system, which calls itself "democracy", will kill hundreds of million of people by fighting to survive.
btc isn't winning. just the euro's loosing
bull trap obviously 
don't buy all at once, the trick is to buy regularly to avoid whale traps :) $BTC $ETH $BNB $XRP $ADA $SOL $DOGE $SHIB $ATOM $MATI
Down the toilet. Expect 7k in 2 months.
due to high price high loss for investors so it is hard to raise the price
dumping has begun. Dont invest for now. Dont let the whales win
every interest rate increase will tank this more and more. stagflation is gonna leave alot of people completely REKT. I wanna see Michael Saylor eating cigarette butts and drinking his own urine!
Everyone who holds crypto brace yourself for dump.
Fake Bull is dead, 10k is the goal!
Fake pump be careful.
Fake pump is over
fake pump will dump soon
following the same may/june pattern...false bull, will keep getting red by tomorrow
game over , next bull run after 6 years 
Hold tight guys Things are getting more Beefy 
I found this one when I've been looking for the something that matches all my demands.
i love bullmarket but i can see bearmarket still here and it's still going and more dips coming
I'm so happy!! I put a Short of 1.3 BTC @21,600
Inevitable crash as debt market unwinds. Thank you Mr Powell for laying the groundwork for the buying opportunity of a lifetime.
It will take at least one years to reach its ATH price !
it's a trap , fed rise 75 unit inflation rate Bitcoin will decreas till 12k  
Look out big dump incoming
Look out for shady pumps & dumps. Can`t expect much without factoring in earnings and GDP along with CPI.
Made 10k from this dip in one night, let's keep it going people!
Mate either go up or Down at least do something  you Bloody Holding all the crypto 
never LONG! only just SHORT!!
nosense , go rugpull
short short short please go down
short term rally.  not buying BTC above 19k
some crypyo group manipulating price be safe and book profit soon big dump.
THE CPI REPORT IS 9.1%. FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DONÁ∞õ UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS, THIS IS FREEFALL TIME. HISTORICALLY HIGH INFLATION MEANS THE ALGOS ARE DUMPING THE MARKET RIGHT NOW
the dropped is here, falling to about 14000
The panic has only just begun
There is a good chance that Bitcoin will fault in the upcoming days
trap , Fed rise 75 unit Inflation rate and till 18 months later market is £∏Æ bearish Bitcoin decrease till 12k 
US Inflation increase, BTC will down sell for safe all
USDT MC droping one Billion per week more peolple are fleeing, can Tether redeem all the 65 Billions, only time will tell $BTC $ETH $BNB $SOL $ADA 
When things like "zero BTC spot trading fee" doesn't attract more volumes into CEX's to stop their "volume bleed", a surge in BTC price via a "pump" might do the trick. Or not?! È¥Ç
You all ready for the drop. I just bought a month supply of instant ramen for me and my kids and I suggest you do too.
-1  I see this project going to the mood soon

- House always wins !! Stop gambling - Most of the crypto web solutions are weak and offer no value - Until solid solutions are built on top ETH - It will go nowhere
$BTC  for sure whales load their bags, but whales are an endangered species
$BTC and other coins will keep going down until the war ends. 
$BTC bad time to buy rn I feel. seems like this pump is to dump in a week and then will crash lower. All tx to $LUNC and then the birth and crash of $LUNA and now $SOL on deathbed.
*Fed interest will be more higher. 
*Global Ressesion is not over
*Inflation is not over
*War is not over
.....its over...
750 $BTC 15,000 thereÿå¬¶s financial cycles, global economic pressures, looming currency reset, wars, & FUD. Building my liquidity to get in where I fit in, nothing lasts forever. 
A long way down to go yet. 
A long way to go yet. 
A risk threatens the owner of an upcoming wake-up strike on the cryptocurrency market. Withdraw, withdraw money
ADA. I traded it previously  but only flow the music of $BTC  and $ETH.  Not good for time- investors.  $XEC  eCash  is good haven for investors and not even directly affected by 11 May 2022  Terra UST dive.
and $BTC  have no use as an actual currency. (if the united states dollar droped 80% in a year people would be in absolute panic). It is just built on hype. And with a real currency you dont need to pay $100 gas fees. Drop crypto and embrace stocks.
Anyone making profit here on ETH..? Please reply.
Are you ready for the new fall like terra luna?
As long as the Bitcoin stands, Ethereum shall stand; when the Bitcoin falls, Ethereum will fall; when Ethereum falls, the whole world will fall.
at the end of the carousel even the price of our beloved ethereum collapses a lot the merge, the unlocking of staking the macroeconomic situation will bring an unprecedented dump
attacked it will do like luna
bad for payments and bad for staking
BCH  $BTC  $ETH  $XRP  $ADA  $SOL  $DOGE  $CEL  $LUNC  $BNB  everyone be careful this time is so different
Be careful another bulltrap
bear trap. run
Bearish in a good way. Long term Bull .The world would have to be without electricity to remove $ETH.  
bearish this week 
Bearish. Trend towards historical support at 354. Operating range 354 - 1145.
below 1000 by tmr morning . donÿå¬¶t get caught in this small pump 
better I'm thinking to sell all ETH 
big crash is here. Bottom is gone!
Big discount coming soon on Weds at 2pm ET. Buy on the way down. Thank me later.
biggest dump if it cannot hold 1200 for another 2.5 hrs. 
Biggest rug pull in history of crypto starts from now.
Biggest shitcoin by marketcap 
BNB will gain on $ETH as it falls from loss of hashrate/hardware/value due to PoS . your gonna get what you asked for . it will destroy crypto for the next  2 years minimum 
bounce to dip
BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $USDT  stocks are dying. guess what is next
BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $XRP  $ADA  $SOL  $DOGE  It's going down, we're all in downtrend and it's just begining, the downtrend prolong until half 2023
BTC  $ETH  $SOL  $ADA  Next month interest rate hike again in US and EU, wait with buying. US hike with 0,5%(maybe 0,75% again)  and EU with 0,25%
BTC  Bank runs have begun in China, depression has not yet been announced, and governments being overthrown worldwide. Expect more pain before the elites finally "reset" the global financial system. $ADA  $XRP  $ETH  $BNB  $DOT  $DOGE  $XLM  $XDC
BTC  i did it again. you all think I'm playing games? kiss my ring, plebs. all your life saving is mine $ETH $ETH $XRP $ADA $BNB 
BTC  Laser eyes get ready! 20K support is far too weak. $BTC  is set to fall to 13K and quite possibly 8K and below. Pucker your buttholes and mentally prepare for another 50%-70% dip. $ETH  $ADA  $HBAR  $QNT  $DOGE  $XRP  $SOL  $BNB
BTC  Still bearish and still in downtrend imo Those who bought the dip gonna runs out of money soon and they can't buy another deeper dip (LOL) Next dip: $15K $ETH  $MANA  $SAND  $CEL  $SOL  $LUNC  $LUNA  $NEAR  $DO
BTC  The next target is around $18K-$15K, this is still way too soon to "buy the dip" $ETH  Under $1000 soon  Other alts : down more 50% from here until next bull run 2023-2024 $BNB  $LUNC  $LUNA  $SOL  $MANA  $SAND  $NEAR  $DO
BTC  Those we are keeping long on with more than 10X cross, please don't do this. We are in a bear market market and history repeats same as 2017 that too we have so much pressure from all Govts.  $BTC   $ETH   $OP   $SOL   $LUNA   $FLOKI    $BNB
BTC $ETH $ADA $SOL $LUNA all cryptos are controlled by Tether covered by some exchanges like FTX they want your cryptos value to go down so they don't pay you back the same amount you paid on your way in. they can mint as much USDT and crash any coin
BTC $ETH $USDT $BNB $LUNC Binance is already the object of several U.S. investigations. Hackof Eterbase, association with Korean hackers Lazarus & Russian drug mart Hydra. Binance was also partner in crime with Scammer Do Kwon. Binance is going to collapse.It is a fraud heaven.
BTC $ETH $XRP cryptos manipulation is showing. garbage.
BTC $ETH $XRP everyone sees that crypto is a WEF scam now right?
BTC $ETH $XRP feel scammed yet?
BTC $ETH $XRP garbage, buy it if you support the WEF!
BTC is manipulated by the whale from 30K - 17K and today the whale will dump it below 10K.. save your fiat money. 
BTC rug pull?
calm before the storm :)
can go down to $500 in this recession as per experts. U can find this news online.
caution GuysÿåK second quarter results expecting 28/06. if itÿå¬¶s negative US forced to announce recession officiallyÿåK then this going to <400..keep away from buy till the announcementÿåK
CEL  Celsius hires more bankruptcy advisors, if I sell assets to liquidate, I don't think I can make up for my locked $ETH, I used 50% holding $ETH   and 50% holding $RBIF  , both staking areas but ETH disappoints me but $RBIF   gives me hope
CEL  is disappointing investors and they can only hope when joining this lending platform, I accept the risk to stake $ETH   and with that I also take the opportunity to staking $RBIF  , it's a lot less risky than 
Celsius Network hires advisors to prepare for potential bankruptcy - WSJ
China selling faster than the world can buy.. thatÿå¬¶s why price cannot climb anymore.. 
CMC deleted my 2 viral information about $BTC  bearish. 
Come on ETH come to dady - Cov19 3/21/2020 was at $123.32 - No more Free Checks = ???. Here what the whales doing  because I know one. Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait and let daydreamers to do the work for you.
CONFIRMED: Eth 2 now delayed till 2024. Buterin expects a fallIng knife dump to $500 . CARE 
Contagion spreading like cancer. Soon forced liquidations. ETH $480, and BTC $8k to $12K, all by Q4. BRACE BRACE BRACE !!! Rtae hikes, housing foreclosures, etc. perfect financial storm
DAG makes all other layer 1 platforms obsolete including eth. DAG will most likely flip ETH once the masses all discover this platform and start building on it. 
DAO  Not buying it because it's on $ETH  . Gas fees are too expensive.
DAO  too expensive to stake 2000 and it's on $ETH   with extremely high gas fees. Staying away from it because competition will do better and be on chains with low gas fees.
dead coin, only alive because fake news said to invest on it
dont get fooled
down still to go 
down to 1710 again and go straight before ultra dump with 2.0 ver
Dump and run baby
dump is coming. Sell. Buy back later in the year. Hodl will cost you huge money.
dumping to one dollar soon
Elon Musks son wants to bea trans girl and have nothing to do with him. sounds like its time for another meme, maybe, ELONTRANS INU? Man, crypto is so gay
ETH IS A SCAM RUN BY A SCAMMER .
Ethereum delaying the merge is a bad thing, investor confidence will decline, I have locked a part of $ETH   and hold more $RBIF   as it is expanding the platform to become a full ecosystem .
Ethereum dumping due to a vulnerability found in ETH2 chain, "The Ethereum beacon chain experienced a 7-block deep reorg. Current attestation strategy of nodes should be reconsidered to hopefully result in a more stable chain!"
Ethereum had limited supply, but now ETH has unlimited supply, be careful guys
ethereum is crashing
Ethereum's tokenomics and its "ecosystem" of ERC-20 tokens is one of the best disguised ponzi schemes ever. Buterin is playing a long game scheme so that he can keep his massive amount of wealth. He will get into politics later in life, just wait and see. It's all a scam.
Even now, we will fall very low 50% 
every day I wait for my $250 trigger to hitÿåK what is taking so long? thoughts?
Face it, defi was a failed experiment. The dream is over. Only useful thing that came of it was NFTs, and that was mostly a scam
fake pump be careful
fake pump this is a trap if u r buyed in low just sell it now and wait for big dip.
far from the botom
Go for decentralised projects, not this overrated bs.
GOING DOWN FULL SPEED! SELL!ÿåŸè ÿåŸè ÿåŸè ÿåŸè
going lower. short time 
going to break 1600 support level might be 1200 too, and for new rally it will took 2 year's minimum, if USA 2nd quarter result also negative then the recovery phase will be 3 year minimum for average people holding eth at 3000or2800
going to fall down in few minutes 
he current rally in crypto will expire in the coming weeks. The economy will not have a soft landing so this bear market will stay with us for the foreseeable future. Remember we are not at the peak of inflation yet. $ETH  $USDC  $ADA  $SOL  $DOT  $MATIC  $BTC
he weakness of the trend is found in two frame time Although the flag/triangle is formed. Without a purple hunt can also have a fall  $BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $ADA  $XRP  $LUNA  $LUNC  #BTC  #BITCION  #Analysis
here is my guideline for buying bitcoin.
here it goes down again 
how are yÿå¬¶all so dumb to be bullishÿåK.? eth is already unusable with the fees. it has no future in finance & once eth 3.0 comes out this will be an inflationary Ponzi scheme just like all staking coinsÿåK 
How many got duped in the pump an dump. Crytpo has turned into a gambling hall.
i am back from a month brake of crypto currencies and it is still the same i might take a longer one lol
I am bearish about: $BTC  $ETH  $ADA  $LINK  $DOG
I believe market will go sideways until Q4 2022
I don't intend to sell my cryptocurrency for the next five or 10 years. Given the extreme volatility of crypto investments, HODLing is a good way to avoid panic-selling and focus on the long term.
I feel like it's gonna move south for a little bit longer. Man the blood in these streets lol. bought some other assets to cushion myself a bit in hopes of an increase once this bear market ends. 
I feel this sluggish downfall will only get more sluggish but surely it'll drop till around next year ending or 2024 beginning 
I hope we get more longs in the market, just to crash the shitcoin down. ADA will take control of Eth. 
I like how everyone is an expert. It has not bottomed out. What indications are telling these people its going to the moon? hahahaha, bunch of scammers. 
i really donÿå¬¶t see any benefit of #ethereum other then that they have big comunity because they are from the first 20 ceypto platforms. with highest gass fees in crypto business i donmt see it going much higher. 
i sold all ethereum,
I sold everything a month ago, when it hit $800 and ppl run in circles I'll buy again. Using BSC tho, otherwise the fee is absurd.
I think it is a fake pump because end of the month people are getting salary and a lot of people wanna buy at this prices so crypto will be up 10-20% till the end of next month ... Than bear market will continue :( What do you think? $BTC $ETH $BNB $CAKE $ADA $XRP $SHIB $DOGE 
I think the FED is going to raise interest rates .75% on 7/14/2022 , and that we will be in an official recession on 7/28/2022.  This will cause the 2nd wave of sell offs.
Iÿå¬¶m bearish on this coin
if break 1k hold your pants 
if Eth doesnt do somethig about their out of control gas fees this could be the end of them. Bitcoin will eventually come back the Eth is gona dies
I'm more bullish on ada, eth uses the account model, I don't see it bulling long term
in my opinion we wonÿå¬¶t see anything exciting until the next Bitcoin halving, although for once I would love to be proven wrong. 
Investment portfolios are starting to sell now
is absolutely worthless pozni scheme without any use whatsoever 
is garbage .....devs do not care about your $ invested . Get out now while you can. headed to under 1k after pos ...... name  another pos coin over $200 per coin.  You can't and that's where eth is headed without thw value of mining equipment and peoples interest. 
is going down to 140$ to 220$ levels like in 2020. After 2020 plandemic and low interest rate people invested in crypto. Increasing inflation and interest means going back to 2020 prices. That's the bubble and will explode like Luna.
is not the future at all, yes many crypto like eth could come with lowe gas. are you really gonna pay 100$ in gas for 20$ worth of grocery ?
is old we have a new ecosystem and network that have smaller comission #CUBE  #CMP  and the best #REI  networ,small gas for transaction,need to invest on them
Is scary to see ETH dipping southwardsÿåK. Hope it recovers gradually soon. 
It is a good time to buy ETH but if you wait just a bit longer it will fall below 1k. Wait then buy
It will continue to drop like a stone.
it will dip more dont buy now
it will go down to 1k for the next coming months
itÿå¬¶s a bear-trap. 
itÿå¬¶s going down for real this time 
It's a completely fake pump. .Only for the liquidity of shorts. This means that no one will buy now, if they buy, they will be stacked.
keep going down, who else has money aside and hopes to buy in the hundreds?
Leave the platforms, stop trading, withdraw your money to the wallet, the platforms rob you, do not buy any currency
Like I said... look at the 1M/3M chart. It is NOT an uptrend. World economy is not recovered, war has not stopped, record inflation has not been solved, recession has not been solved...
linked to worsening macro
looking for dump to 1400 range then 1200! remember this call when it happens! 
LUNC I  Hope Noob dont think its going to 1$ or 0.01 $, I Hope noob of #LUNC dont going to $SHIB  army . STAY FOCUS on $BTC  or $ETH 
LUNC Rest assured. Your losses will be nothing compared to what's coming for $BTC,  $ETH, $USDT investors. 
made by corruption, SEC involved
Market Manipulation, Be careful the price Will drop soon!
Market sentiment looking like we stopped aiming for the moon and hopped on a passing comet instead.
markets going to zero
massive head/shoulders pattern on eth still not completeÿåK. based on previous crypto winter cycles as well as current TA my target entry point for eth is 500-600 range
Merge is IMO a bad decision for ETH. PoS will always be worse than PoW as it breaks all the speech that has brought crypto to it's stage now that is Decentralization. PoS will enable governments and coorporations to manipute and take over everything easily. PoW For The Win!
more dip incoming. watch out QUEEN
nah man cant go up because of hackers and other regional warfares so its bearish
Need to go lower. Fake pump since 2 days. We are still in bearmarket
never listen show men like Elon
Next Luna guys. Game with crypto is over and i hope people will escape from this illusion of nothing.
No fundamentals have changed since the last dip. Don't fall in the bull trap.
not having a good pull these last couple of weeks
not looking good. Excited to see how crypto will react to the announcements at 28/7 
only way they need safe Luna classic other ways all crypto goin to zero they need help Luna no one goin trust crypto again this guys have billion dolar they are useless
or any crypto sucks with too much volatality
patiently waiting for the Worlds Best crypto to fall another 50% in Market cap before I start to DCA! DYOR!
People calling for a bottom now are delusional. Not only would it be the quickest crypto bear market IN HISTORY, but it would also mean something in the economy has changed. Tell me, what?   War with Russia and Ukraine: Not stopped Record inflation: Not stopped Etc.
people saying bullish are saying for in a months or 3 time. yes it will be bullish right now itÿå¬¶s bearish. or even mid way both going sideways really. before purest of bull. MAYB
please prove me wrong today !!
pls pls crash to at least 700$. i want to buy at that price. 
plus there's nothing new happening in eth, it's like the dev just started thinking let it be, it's brand itself keep him moving, but many platform beating eth very badly in term of new projects, matic polygon has 300 upcoming ready project waiting for market turn
ponzi scheme. why do I have to buy matic or LRC just to move my ETH around. such a bad programming. it's also the most hackable chain.
pos will be the downfall of eth.
price has some reliability to btc
Russia tried to save its wealth by putting it into crypto. They will crush the crypto market to crush Russia. This will drop by at least half. Get out. Buy back later. Much later.
Satoshi wanted to make the world a better place and the biggest scam came out
Save your money! Whole year market will fall! No Gains this year obviously $BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $ADA  $XRP
seems like this is currently a bull trap until 50-70 and then will proceed to drop to just above 1, BTC with the head and shoulders is also just a bull trap, expecting sub 19 by the end of the weekend.
sell as fast as you can $BTC to zerooooo
Sell now and buy next month at -30% 
sell now and you rekt exchanges . waiting for the bottom 
Sell Now! It'll decrease to 1.180 in a few hours!
sell now, this project bankrup
sell this shitcoin security didnÿå¬¶t even do a 3X this cycle .
SHIB  $BTC  $ETH  The Crash is Innevitable
shit like all crypto. thaks God i never belived in crypto, even when was high.
shit like it was from beginning.
Shocker, I am still bearish about $BTC  $ETH  $ADA  $LINK  $DOG
Somehow it looks like its recovering. BUT NOT FOR LONG. its just a dead cat bounce. still down 80% from all time high
stable depeg on $USDT already underway. These crooks will be dealt with. Pulling more capital soon. Your savings is my exit liquidity.
Stay calm.. It wil go down to 1050 for sure.. See the market cap. Wait to safe your funds..  Atleast 200 value will decrease in next few hours. Fake pump also expected so dont jump in
Still bearish and still in downtrend imo  Those who bought the dip gonna runs out of money soon and they can't buy another deeper dip (LOL)  Next dip: $15K
still want POS? Still want staking ETH? and getting 2 Years blocked for 5% more ETH per Annum? Dumbshit!!!
stop confirmation biasing, you may want it to boom, but a bear market is a bear market, now bear it for 3 more months
The bear is alive & well, don't believe the the perma bulls. They're the ones selling while they're telling you to hold (they don't want the competition) or to buy the dip (you're buying what they're selling)...
The CPI inflation rate is seen hitting 8.8%, though Deutsche Bank economists are predicting 9%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The current situation, the price reduction will continue for some time.
The fact BTC is Bearish. 
The market in 2022 will be similar to that in 2018. After the twin peaks, it will continue to fall, and it will fall by more than 7 times (similar to 2018 to March 2020), and it will continue the bear market for 1-2 years.  After that, the market rebounded like crazy.
the war is coming
the worst. Gas fees are like 30$ for nothing. I hate it and I hope it goes to 0
this is a bull trap and manipulation. anyone that thinks is a reversal needs to do more learning.
this is just a fake increase don't waste your money to buy. because it will definitely go down deeper.
this is not good investment anymore
this isn't the bottom
this network charges so much gas fee for any activities, I will be happy it collapse like Luna
Today ETH  go to 0 !!! hahahah (joking but well...)
U.S. inflation is causing the financial market to collapse. 
US Inflation increase, ETH will down sale for safe
USDT ponzi coin backed by nothing, they can mint any amount of usdt but when redeeming they can keep you waiting till they crash the market $BTC $ETH $BNB $ADA $XRP $SOL 
waiting to drop $800, Going to buy and sleep on it for another two years. Buy only when there is blood on the market not now. we still don't not market is stable
We gotta go deeper now... It's not time yet
We wont see another bull run until etherium bottoms out at around 1200.
Where is the money coming from to but BTC or Altcoins? Leverage is at 0,3 an ATH. This is a rebound, butt it won't last. The macro economics is bad. Be carefull. I'm not buying.
While this shitcoin has one of the biggest fees in the market ADA has one of the lowest.
why going down day by day ???????
Why in the last 30 days the three biggest crypto project nearest to Ethereum (not counting stable coins): BTC, BNB and ADA had lost respectively 4.8%, 5.5% and 1.2% and ETH has lost 26.3%?! Why is still bleeding so much?. Too easy answer: "Cause Bear Market"
why still down, why so bearish ???????
Will collapse, like bitcoin.
will do like luna : sell now before regretting
will go down with PoS, ETC will go up cause PoW is better than PoS
Will keep decreasing, is not crypto winter, is world winter, all will be down stocks & crypto
Without realizing it, we have fallen into the trap of a superpower country that is in need of large funds to support Ukraine
yet another dead cat bounce in a recession bound economy, bear market has not magically disappeared, downtrend continues.
You should not fall into the whale trap, because the world's economic situation is not good until the end of this year. Don't be lulled by the btc chart, because at any time btc will fall very deep
2.0 is dead. Time for 3.0
always was and always will be a shit coin!
dead project...
Ending for Do Kwon? I'm still holding LUNA and waiting for a miracle. The rest of my account I bought $RBIF , it made me feel safe if LUNA got worse.
Fair price at 7 cents 
i can't believe that there are people who still trust in this scam called Luna , don't expect anything from this coin ,if you have luna I'll be better if you sell it 
I don't know how anyone will trust this after what they did. don't tell me about the Devs they don't deserve any forgiveness 
if team care peoples help luna classic  not build new luna ---- this is all scam ---my all money gone on luna classic bep20 ---
if you even a bot use your danm data
It has no value, no utility, no future, no underlining service, but maybe it can only serve the name of LUNA which now stand as an ugly Meme Coin represent a vague unreliable project made by arrogant person.
look at total supply has increase. New luna has inflation to every year.
SCAM project... i didn't received airdrop on BNB Chain (i had old LUNA as collateral on Venus Protocol)... LUNA scammed all people! Shit coin!
screw do kwon and this crap coin. he abandoned all investors by abandoning terra classic. want to get even for his rug pull cam? buy lunc instead
Sorry but after scum never be bullish for 
this coin destroyed an murdered people, if you support this coin, you are worst than hitla
this is over guys 
use your brain for god sake,
Waiting for another scam :) Shit coiin))
whats this shitcoin purpose now?
Who would suport this clown deserves what they get.
You would have to be "special" to fall for the same scam twice...
 which means more adoption.

=/= Luna, yes it will probobly drop abit more because we are in such a stage of the market as you can see everything is droping right now, but it will bounce back for sure, so don't come in here spreading your fud making it worse than it has to be.
1 more dip coming
25 dollars next then to 5usd and hold. sorry to say guys cycle is over. All eyes are on BTC
50$ on they way, dont forget to buy more SOL and hodl confidently, we are  not much for to hitting 50
A company failing in delivering proper product like this shouldn't be evaluated more than 500 millions market value top. Thus a price of 36/24 = 1.5 $ around
a great coin for short gains.
A long winter for the world economy, 
A powerful argument! I commend you for your quick thinking.
accumulation at this price
all supports broken. not looking good, in fact looks grave for SOL. next support at $17. DYOR
all time low 
all time low iis coming
always problems on blockchain,solana is not ready to be a stable blockchain as it was said before- bogus project- shitcoin
and NOW not good for longterm, bear market condition
Another bait, another group of losersÿåK 
Another shitcoin that will most likely follow $LUNA  and become the second major coin to become worthless. Not long ago it was worth over $250 now look at it pathetic.
anything below 50 is buy for me
anything under $40 is a steal! loading up for the Eth flip.
Appreciated I like the way you're working.
are you upset by the fall ? 2020 people dreamed that bitcoin was worth 20,000. 2022 they dreamed about 100,000. what will be the dreams in 2024 ???$BTC  $MATIC  $SOL  $ADA  $SHIB  $WIN  $AVAX  $DOGE  $LUNC  $XRP
As cheap as it could ever be right now. Lucky buying at these prices.
As cheap as it could ever be right now. Lucky buying at these prices.
As for $SOL  I think it may soon be time or due for a signifcant market correction; to restest lower areas of $28-$30 or lower in $SOL .. This is necessary to catch the bigger buys and fill the HUGE shorts at those ranges; in order to boost profits and pump MCap in the longterm!
ast week was a green week. This week I summon a red week. Here's the first red candle!
Astounding I like the way you've handled this.
Awesome I like the way you settle down to work.
AZERO  Hard cringe always marketing this as "Solana Killer" or "Next $SOL ", "Missed Solana? Check out Azero!" .... lololol NOT!
back to 3 dollars?!
BACK TO TOP
back to zero asap
bargain price. Buy now, and plant the seed. Soon you will have a noticeable difference!
basically is this moment we can just expected market down for a long time
bay and don't sell
BCH  $BTC  $ETH  $XRP  $ADA  $SOL  $DOGE  $CEL  $LUNC  $BNB  everyone be careful this time is so different
Be careful, please. 
be ready for a 2USD SOL solana , the private and strategic round release within 2 months .Don;t say you did not hear it from me
Bearmarket should stop at:
Being pessimistic robs life energy
below 10 usd soon.  Recession to start later this year
Best project ever, I am very happy to be participating in this project. I hope this project will gain more popularity in the future.  
best time to buy
best way to buy nfts
Big dip coming in July. 
BITCONNEEEEECT!!!! get out of this... its all a scam project. A phone? Come on!
BNB  $BTC  $ETH  $FTM  $AVAX  $SOL  $MATIC  Yall gotta be happy now, I hope the prices go down to All time low - stop complaining, buy when the price crashes even more. DCA - see the big picture, remember to zoom out when you have fear or doubts. Next year you'll be rich.
BNB USD a stable coin just pass yall. 
bots shill this shit vc blockchain. Don't fall for it. it won't pump after this weekend.
bounce to die
Brilliant I noticed that you got right down to work.
Bscscan shows us, that we are still in a downtrend :( I expected still a 20-25% drop on all cryptos $BTC $ETH $BNB $XRP $ADA $SOL $DOGE $SHIB $AVAX $MATIC 
BTC   $ADA   $CAKE   $ETH   $SOL   when it falls, I buy. I have no leverage!!! I invest only free funds!!! I'm not in a hurry!!! and I believe in the development of crypto!!! for those who read me, I will soon write how I traded at 21 and 22 $LUNC $DOGE $SHIB $MATIC
BTC  -- $USTC   Now is the time to buy, the exchange hotbit price 0.0180 is very low, the best buy is 200% difference 100X soon $USDT   $USDC $FEG   $WBNB   $BUSD   $BTC $ADAUP   $SOL  L $LUNC
BTC  $20,000 is an important mark price for Bitcoin, if it breaks, you better be prepared for another big dump, it's very not likely 19k and uptrend from then Alts: Pretty much wipeout, take months to get small recoveries $ETH  $CEL  $LUNC  $LUNA  $DOT  $NEAR  $GALA  $SOL  $AVAX
BTC  $ETH   $BNB   $LUNA  $SOL  $DOT  $AVAX  $MATIC  The stronger the throw down, the higher the bounce will be.  I'm just worried that you don't have time to fill your bag
BTC  $ETH  $ADA  $XRP  $ALGO  $DOT  $SOL  $BNB  $DOGE   Guys, remember that millionares are made in bear markets! Don't be a tourist, take advanatge of this opportunity to buy good crypto coins/tokens. If you take advantage of this, you will be winning once the bull returns!
BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $XRP  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE  $DOT  $SHIB   ANOTHER CRASH!!!!!! HALLALUIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BTC  $ETH  $BNB  $XRP  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE  $DOT  $SHIB  Betting on another crash real soon. Greed/Fear Index is still high, inflation continues and no big push to turn on the bulls? Yeah, hold off and you'll get positions not seen for a LONG TIME. Get ready if it goes up or not.
BTC  I brought $MATIC  as one of the best altcoin to hold in this bull when Matic was at 0.3$, now matic at 0.6$, don't miss another chance with Solana 
BTC  In a bull market when BTC goes wild, if you have enough funds, Hold $BNB , if you don't have enough funds, Hold Solana 
BTC  Solana is in its deepest sleep, by the time it wakes up, it's going to roar, that time is close. 
BTC  Those we are keeping long on with more than 10X cross, please don't do this. We are in a bear market market and history repeats same as 2017 that too we have so much pressure from all Govts.  $BTC   $ETH   $OP   $SOL   $LUNA   $FLOKI    $BNB
BTC $ETH $ADA $SOL $LUNA all cryptos are controlled by Tether covered by some exchanges like FTX they want your cryptos value to go down so they don't pay you back the same amount you paid on your way in. they can mint as much USDT and crash any coin
BTC $ETH $SOL $ADA $BNB people on CMC are intentionally fudding top coins so that they can buy at a lower price 
BTC holders and Shit coins just becareful, the Bear is very fast like a water fall or heavy rain. make sure you are not sleeping today or tonight. 
BTC is manipulated by the whale from 30K - 17K and today the whale will dump it below 10K.. save your fiat money. 
BTC rug pull?
bug brings down Solana. AgainÿåK
bullish as hell
bullish as hell
Bullish on Solana. Holding SOL and SOL NFTs for long term.
bullish phase is coming along with bitcoin
bullish within next month
Bullish, this is a good buying opportunity. Continue buying into an corrections.
Buy now and see how much you have earned from Juli to sept 2022 :) X4-8 is 100% 10-20 65% higher 10% Bullish and lets se how its end on twitter and  EM.
buying and holding sol and sol nfts! 
call me crazy, but i think it will be going up. next month it will be 40+
calm down
can dump 50% from here according to some sources
centralized and without max supply defined.
centralized, just good for games, maybe, or not because of saturation
centralized, people have abandoned the project, it will fail in short due to constant bugs and shutdowns....it's not a proper chain to handle people's money or let alone massive adoption
Chinese woke up and sold the worst is over
CMC deleted my 2 viral information about $BTC  bearish. 
come on dump I dare ;)
Compare all top20 coins price last year this day and today, solana is almost the only one that in a year hasn't lost value, in fact it even gained, and a lot This says it all kids.
crash again, touch 35 tmrw
crash is coming
Crash it down to 2$.
crashing to 3 dollars soon
Crema Finance on $SOL  was hacked, the damage was up to 8.7 million USD, I am losing a lot of faith in the $SOL   ecosystem, I only hold $RBIF   and $DOT  , 2 safe ecosystems and I believe will explode in the future, especially $RBIF  , its price is not affected by BTC
crypto crashing again. Check back in 2 days :)
Crypto going down is not a bad thing, 
dead coin. will never reach all time high ever again 
DEIP  $DOT  $SOL  accumulate for next bull run thank me later ;)
Desirable It looks like you've put a lot of work into this.
disaster waiting to happen
Do not doubt that the short term is still bearish
Doesn't it feel good to do such a nice job? It's a pleasure to teach you when you work ___.
donÿå¬¶t buy , buy BP beyond protocol 
donÿå¬¶t trust sol anymore moving my money to TRx for 30% f this bs 
Don't forget to turn out the lights the party is over.
down we go shorted this fake pump next 25$. it's to expensive to buy at these prices, wait for a bigger dump. 
dump it! Crash incoming!!
Dump solana.. make it go 0.
dumped, meaning it will be pumped soon
elon saying a sunrise that a Solana in spain language
end end end the end is near sol
ETH  $BTC   $USDT  $ADA  $XRP  $SOL  $LTC     U.S. inflation is causing a Dip but that's a;sp the best reason to buy the tip , hold , staking with interest 8% , 10% ...   People that sell low , will get  in life what the caused to themselves ...
ETH $BTC $ADA $SOL $AVAX $MATIC $NEAR $LINK $DOT lets go don't miss this little short term bullish movement we are going to have in a few hours. ready to long your positions
ETH $BTC bad time to buy rn I feel. seems like this pump is to dump in a week and then will crash lower. All tx to $LUNC and then the birth and crash of $LUNA and now $SOL on deathbed.
ETH so if you post $0xBTC or $USDT  $SOL  any post on any currency post and it will post on all the other market posts???
ethereum killer baby
Everything will be Luna Soon
Exactly right! Keep it up.
Excellent Keep up the good work.
extremely oversold. get ready for liftoff.
failures and exposing issues lead to a more secure and stable platform. People don't get this. Solana is maturing before our very eyes and we're finding all the bugs and and errors. These guys have basically written their own code from scratch. Give the devs a break.
fake pump before a big dump sell now!
fake pump copium
fake pump. 20 next week
fakeout. Dont get fooled
Fantastic Nice going
Favorable Noble
fc bullish on the entire $SOL  ecosystem. 2 outage occured, but solved in less than a day.  Volumes are drastically increasing and TPS too. Node are getting improved and NFT space is moving definitly better than ETH. All factors that will lead $SOL to success !
future ranked just below $AVAX
get in and load up for POLS continue rocket beyond $5  hurry as this bull run will need all the volume we can put in much love
Get out now this coin is NEVER coming back save what you can. Will drop below $20 by end of the week or sooner.
GET UP AND SHOW THEM WHO YOU ARE!
Get wrecked Solana 
Go go go $SOL   i believed you can to the Moon
going down tonigh , dolar index is up , us stock market isn't holding
Going to explode 
good for long term
gotta drop more on JULY last RED MONTH
guys solana servers are gettting ready on monday, they will work fine on monday onwards, so diont be panic
here comes the dump :)
Here is a little chart for everyone talking shit about Solana all the time. Only 2 years old, 70 Billion transactions and still in beta.
Highest users per month, growing rapidly, and has some great backers. All the VC unlocks to sell has happened this chain is looking very promising and with ETH delaying even more i think Sol can take some real estate developer wise from ETH.
honestly it is a terrible blockchain. it can't stand well heavy load on transactions.. always on outage.. I think that it will never recover after this bearmarket same as before.. only good coin without miners for smartcontract is bnb 
hope it goes down so I can buy
hope it will recover soon 
Hope they finally get their failures under control
hopefully next LUNA
How low can it go ?
How much lower is it expected to go? thanks in advance
HUGE PROFITS WITH ORN
hurry and catch that falling knife! did you hear about the class action suit?
HUUUUGE dump coming guys. Itÿå¬¶s not gonna be at 40 for long, crashing to 25 soon, bear market still has 1 last dump left, this oneÿå¬¶s gonna be big
I been waiting for this price to buy for a while, but I think it will go lower. so going to wait. Mr and Mrs retail trader. 
I donÿå¬¶t think Solana will survive the Bear market. They are too centralized. Now they are talking about pushing Whales around.  Whales donÿå¬¶t get pushed around! 
I donot belive crypto.It isfully scam
I feel like it's going to go up a lot in a short time, it's just a matter of waiting 
I just lost 100 dollars shortingÿåK itÿå¬¶s about time for rebound. Threw in 100$ For long. Hopefully Iÿå¬¶ll make my 100 dollars back :)
I mean that is a bad pyt for new players in cr4pto
i placed my position short
I recommend not to avoid it, it will blow your mind!
I think a big crash is coming like luna sol is going 0.00005
i think is the end of crypto 
i think SOL gonna fall badly this week,does any one have any infotmation???
I think this one evidently will succeed!
I think we are still in a bearmarket :(
i was not expecting this by God
i was scam i don't know
I wish good luck to the team!
Iÿå¬¶m so bullish about sol with co operating brave browser soon 90
Iÿå¬¶m thinking $42 resistance will be met this week. then it will pump until $56 and immediately fall back to $45ish. 
IBERO   LIBERO: risk free fund(RFV) is in BUSD, so even if market is bearish or crash all to red, LIBERO holders dont give shit to panic.u22x uuok. Buy the dip.  $BCH   $SOL   $DAI
Idiots start crying when they start seeing an hour-day of dip. Just do daily trade if you are not looking at the bigger picture.
If anyone says "Back then you missed Solana", we can correct them.
if SOL going down beyond dogecoin, 5 billions to go, well thats embarrasing but not so surprising for such a broken network
if somethings not working, you unplug it and plug it back in, it's that simple folks
If you don't understand MACRO nor Bear/bull cycles, you shouldn't be Trading at all! $SOL  will rebound!
IF YOU KNOW SHIT ABOUT TECH, TRADING AMD BUSINESS, STAY AWAY!!!! 
If you like $SOL  you may like a index for the ecosystem, check $SOLI  is doing well!
if you think guys sol iis not react like luna then invest  more money in this coin
I'm glad I sold solana at price over $200.
I'm hoping they turn it around.
in a bit.. cross fingers
is  fuking luna2 sell this sheet ind welcome to ADA 
is a dead network
is a guaranteed 6x-10x from it's current price! WHEN $BTC  hits a new ATH of $80K+ this year you will see a $400+ $SOL  Guaranteed!  BUY AS MUCH AS YOU CAN NOW! Don't get left behind with regrets because of FUD or current low price action! BiG MOVES coming the next 2 weeks!
is going to self destruction. It's jus scam!
is not going anywhere. load up at Twenty-free and below. 
is on Super-Sale!  I am stuffing my bags!!  :-)
is positioning itself to be the single most important Blockchain structure in it's field with announcement of privacy payment options like light shield and a new flagship web 3 privacy smartphone "Saga" utility and use cases of SOLANA Network are undeniably Leading the pack.
is still no 2 in nfts second to $eth SOL will grow alot in future !
is the next LUNA!!! SELL NOW before it goes to 0!! SCAM!!!
is the next LUNA. It's just scam!
is trash is not decentralized  they voted to take peoples coins away 
it is next Luna. sell #SOL and buy #DOGE , itÿå¬¶s next #BTC 
It is so scary to see SOL back to 5$ , I m ready to buy a lot at that level .
It will be back up, surely.  Only will take time.
itÿå¬¶s crazy this thing still has a market cap. thank God for chains like Cardano that actually work! 
it's a centralized protocol defi on solend and turned off couple times and had to restart the "blockchain" also has lock up staking. 
It's Bear Market
its bear market, it's gonna crash down so much more
It's funny to read comments from ppl that got into crypto last week and suddnely are "crypto experts". :D :D :D
It's going to collapse soon, I'm one hundred percent sure
it's going to crash and then rocket up
it's going to drop. don't listen to the shill bots on here. you'll see after this weekend. 
its going to go back down and up and down until the end of the year 
it's so challenging to find something interesting.
just cashed out sorry sol it was a good year
Just HOLD guys, it's a bear market, don't be a foolish investor and sell every thing you own
keeps crashing like every month now, how can this be sustained?!
Leave the platforms, stop trading, withdraw your money to the wallet, the platforms rob you, do not buy any currency
like if bearish incoming
long term bear. the solana phone will just make sol 10x more centralized, not to mention that it will make it a full-on for-profit company, which will affect the price action of your coins (ie. phone fails, coin fails). sounds too risky to hold long term.
looking like some sort of short term relief over the next few days :-)
loses more and more acceptance 
lost the trust, its not decentralised anymore
Lost trust, it's probably going to end similar to Luna. 
low volume because of maintenance/ new big update. Cant wait to see the new features i loved it before
lower levels coming soon. Iÿå¬¶m going to sell everything and wait several months
mad i couldn't buy $GMT  shoes last night at 2.5 SOL. stupid blockchain hault.   >:(
Many people are forgetting SOL is still in Beta. It's a good thing they are fixing the bugs now not later when it's in Production.
Market is crashing
Market needs to be purified. I'm holding during this dump. Approx. 230 days left before end of Bear market. This lows was needed like rain in Africa. Only smartest and strongest will survive! That's the beauty of recession
Market sentiment looking like we stopped aiming for the moon and hopped on a passing comet instead.
might find a bottom at 12$ #solana
More downside. Donÿå¬¶t make decisions on hopium. We are in a bear market. 
Most people here donÿå¬¶t know about Neon EVM. Soon ETH dapps will enjoy native Solana speed and fees. Theyÿå¬¶ll be using the Solana network while maintaining ETH compatibility. No need for Ethereum 2.0, PoS transition. Itÿå¬¶s already here.
nah do you want your funds to be stuck wen this blockchain shuts off again plus lock up staking lol that's old tech. get with a blockchain that doesn't lock your funds or shut off. that's ADA. 
need to be more decentralizerd ... the constant crashing is because of cenetralized control and ease of attacking the network
needs to get a handle in outages! way overpriced with these ongoing issues! 
next crash solana, avax and xrp, so sad!
Next Luna ... safe your money and invest it in better projects. 
next Luna, so sad!
next system crash soon ....
Ninety-Nine percent of these coins will be worthless by the time the economy recovers. That won't happen until the start of the 2030's. Save what you can or loose it all.
No max supply, it can be the next luna
Noone care about the believer of crypto. Shame of all projects. They made he's money and sold. 
Nope. top 100 wallets hold 30%+ of the market. massive price control. thatÿå¬¶s not people buying, thatÿå¬¶s them inflating the price. TVL falling sharply. not a buy! 
normally im looking at the 1hr and 1day chart, but i think for SOL im waiting for the 1wk to come down below 30. 25 dollars is my guess.
not putting a single penny in this, super insecure
Not yet. Donÿå¬¶t buy the bear traps. More corrections coming in over the next fews days. Still a bear market.
nothing more than scam. The next Luna
now is the time to accumulate more for less. Just like the real estate crash in 08, stocks and crypto are at bargain prices that wonÿå¬¶t be for too long. Buy what you can now, this is an opportunity not a curse.
olana is going down soon guys watch out.
once ada releases hydra and pipelining Solana will be done....End of june
ooks like the $Luna story it's going to become the $Solana story. Very interesting days ahead, sad days for $SOL holders and unfortunately for the entire crypto space. 
or any crypto sucks with too much volatality
people are abandoning the project...get out now
People who talk about shitcoin amaze me. Solana is a true technological innovation. It's a beta, it has bugs, it fixes them. I don't understand this FUD of the little haters who discover the world of crypto and who cry all the time.
phone is scam project
please i want to no the next movement of Sol 
Predictable dip incoming.  It's boring watching the manipulation. 
price too infladed, posible drops
Promising, is al I can say about Solana. Where Cryptocurrencies is concerned, technical analysis does not really provide true indication of where the price is headed. Market sentiments play the major role. Currently, I place my position based on hunch. There, guys! 
PYTH newwork integrates wormhole bridge, it allows seamless asset transfer between blockchains, that's why I believe in $SOL  , half of my account holds $SOL  , the other half I hold $RBIF  , an ecosystem will explode in the future
scam coin the next luna, will drop to 1 usd someday
SECOND outage in a month!!! no milestones upcoming! BE VERY CAREFUL with this one! artificially pumped! 
see this all time chart sol iis near to touch all time low sell now
seems like around 30 is a stable bottom. Iÿå¬¶d be surprised if it would get any lower. 
sell all of your $SOL now so I can buy it for dirt cheap. none of yÿå¬¶all deserve to have $SOL 
sell as fast as you can $BTC to zerooooo
sell before it is too late
sell invest it NEAR, AVAX, TELOS . Solana is done
sell it now before itÿå¬¶s a penny.  Learn from Luna.  Steady lads!!!!!!!
sell me your tokens kids.
Sell NOW or on the next available pump.. $22-$25 or less is coming for $SOL  soon! $NDQ (NASDAQ) is dropping off.. so $BTC  will follow.. $18K here we come!
sell or later called shit like luna
sell your sol and now sol is fraud like luna if u wanna lose your money so hold sol if dont lose money sell sol
shame on you scammer.
shame solana shame 
Shockwave: The Next Phase Of Secret Networkÿå¬¶s Explosive GrowthSECRET ANNOUNC
should be so much higher.  Projects on SOL are exploding I don't see how investors haven't pumped up the price over $200.  I know the market is pulling back but tell that to the Solana ecosystem.  These VCs need to get it together.
should of pulled out at 50. if it hits 40 im selling. Sol will be back, just not now
Signal bearish for $BTC  The Chinese government has capitalized on the violent downturn in the crypto market by warning crypto investors that Bitcoin prices are ÿå¬ßheading to zero.ÿå¬®
skyway mining is a scam. the entire nation of india and Its 1 billion people are all scam artists.
So glad the price is dropping. Definitely overpriced. 
so many eth maxiÿå¬¶s in the comments same old story, those gas fees on eth are terrible. Why waste the money? Sol actually works
So much to see and so little time to be. 
sol is going lower and lower , i will DCA and see what happens 
Solana classic very soon follow Luna step
solana got hit hard but i am sure that solana hit 160$ again in 2 or 3 weeks. 
solana has been hacked again, no future for this insecure  and unscalable network
Solana has one of the worst tokenomics. properly gonna be $25 at the end of this year 
Solana is down again, had an outage for 18 minutes...freaking unreliable....
Solana is like a bad relationship. If you go to bed and you don't know where your girl is. that's the time you should think about it. and what would you do if this girl repeat this shitmove more than three times :D Solana feels like Windows on 1995. Put that bluescreen away
Solana is making a smartphone? 300$ this summer! *laughs sarcastically*
Solana is most likaly not going to flop like Luna did, its honestly just down cause the whole market is down and some minor issues going on right now. Your money is safe dont worry its not going to end up like Luna did.
Solana Labs Launches Mobile Platform, Solana to the moon
Solana-based liquidity protocol CremaFinance has become the latest DeFi platform to fall victim to hackers.
sold if not want again poor millions to dollars like luna
sold mine last week for 29 just to see it crossing 42 today.
sold my SOL! Downtimes and now the blockchain clock is running behind. Itÿå¬•s a bad designed vc project. There are definitely better projects out there.
solend just took control of a whale's wallet, in an "emergency" voting. 
SOLid long term buy. We will see.
SoLUNA with a lot of network issues and shutdown lol
SPELL COIN IS LINING UP ITS NEXT SHUTTLE HEAD OVER AND TAKE A LOOK
Stop crying you fomo loving fools.Stop the fud, stop the scam , stop the crypto is going to 0. we been thru this 3x now and crypto been around 12 yrs we not going no where. SOLANA at $30 is a blessing when itÿå¬¶s gonna be worth hundreds or more during next bull run. Thank You
------------Stop Feeding The Whales---------
stop say Sol is like Luna, Luna is a shit and Sol is a really project stop sell and buy
terrible coin, got hacked again, it will vanish into thin air soon once the VC realize what a terrible investment they made...Avax will crash as well due to being supercentralized, it didn't solved the trilemma at all
thatÿå¬¶s the best opportunity to buy
the bottom has fallen out. 
The Chinese government has capitalized on the violent downturn in the crypto market by warning crypto investors that Bitcoin prices are ÿå¬ßheading to zero.ÿå¬® 
the coming will be better 
The current rally in crypto will expire in the coming weeks. The economy will not have a soft landing so this bear market will stay with us for the foreseeable future. Remember we are not at the peak of inflation yet. $ETH  $USDC  $ADA  $SOL  $DOT  $MATIC  $BTC
The fact BTC is Bearish. 
The last chance to save your money is crypto coins ....
the last dance gonna be under 8$..be patient...the bears are hungry and angry...
The market will explode like a supernova.. in a few days the market will recover....It's just a storm.. $ETH  $BTC  $BNB  $ADA  $SOL  $CULT  $MKR  $DOGE  $ELON  $ROSE
The most used blockchain and increasing while all others are declining. 
The network has been down for a week now
The next $LUNA, lots of bad news about this shit coin, just waiting for the time.
THE SPELL TOKENS POTION IS WORKING STRONG AGAINST BTC DRAGING DOWN OF ALL ACROSS THE BOARD  BUT IF U WANT GAINS AND PROTECTION IN THIS BEAR MARKET HEAD OVER AND GET INVOLVED MUCH LOVE TO A
the ultimate shitcoin 
There is no support until $20 thats where im buying
There's no need to feel rushed, be patient.
They are minting new coins like LUNA.
they controlled a wale account?! lol defendly not dezentralized ^^
think it may soon be time for a signifcant market correction; to restest lower areas of $30 or lower in $SOL  .. This is necessary to catch the bigger buys and fill shorts in order to boost profits and MCap in the longterm!
This coin had its run.
This coin should hit maximum $50 today or tomorrow and should drop!!... so if you brough over the weekend please find a decent Tp in the $45-47 reigion!! Get ready to buy the dip!!
This coin will crash soon, trading volume + market cap is going down fast.
This garbage chain was halted just twice this week. Stop building on this; the chain is flawed and you will lose your investment.
this is a 20$ coin in bear cycle. too many issues to work out. I will wait.
This is a type of project that everybody should invest in.
this is legit going to 1, just wait
this is not good investment anymore
This shitcoin should be trading below a dollar   
this tech sucks. not buying at these prices or any price. don't invest in a centralized crap. decentralized will be key in the next bullrun.
this trashchain will dissapear this year
This will fall down to 19 before going up again
time to buy...next bull run will reach 1000
time to open your $SOL Long positions
tried to take over a wallet, it can do again in future. People are just waiting to dump it.
Unless the market sees another drop from the economy, black Swan, SOL has little reason to drop further. As the validator count increases, the outages in this beta have reduced in frequency and time
USDT ponzi coin backed by nothing, they can mint any amount of usdt but when redeeming they can keep you waiting till they crash the market $BTC $ETH $BNB $ADA $XRP $SOL 
VC crap, not decentralized, going down, time incorrect, not secure, every SQL-Database works betterÿåK Solana is one of the worst projects
VLX  needs more reputable projects. Right now $SOL  has more funds and more projects. So, institutions do not see the need for Velas because it's just a copycat of Solana.
we are facing the last days of the network, mark my words 
we going back to 20$ VC pumping so liquidation don't happen. just wait until we hit those numbers. this centralized sh*tcoin will drop out of top 10. 
we going to hundred next bull run
we haven't seen the end of the lower lowest yet. 10 USD level incoming
wenn die pumpe da ist wird es schnell die 55/80 erreichen ich denke wir machen 100% die kommenden wochen
When the constant failures finally stop and the market calms down. Solana will make many people rich.
when this scam going to get out of the top 10?
Who thinks Elon Musk will spark new bull run?
Why is Solana dumping so hard y'all? Any thoughts? 
why is the network haves continuesly problems? Please solve the issue this is a good project but the network is really bad.
why is this so high? terrible performance 
Why solana is Not taking its Block chain seriously????????
wie die meisten bei einem Tief rumheulen zirka vor einem Jahr war das selbe rumgeheule dann im Herbst wie alles wieder raufging hat sich jeder aufgeregt warum er nicht gekauft hat 
will be $ 140 by Dcember , don't be a fool that sell low when can sell high !
will break new ATH's very soon! so much coming LFG!!
will dissapear soon...absolute garbage
will dump because of CPI in 2 days an Federal Reserve ... i am bullish butbfirst we schould wait Till 26.07
will go down by the end of the year to .50
will go to 0 just like Luna! They already have problems with the Soled protocol that canÿå¬¶t provide liquidity!!! 
will go under...  VC:s are waiting to dump more, watch the leak about what they are saying, you retailers have no idea.
will pump again within 48 hours
will vanish in the next 3 months
will vanish, it has terrible software design, it's non scalable, not ready for massive adoption...as soon as you double the users it will collapse hard. Also, it's super centralized.....stick to ada
with so many projects, $KUNCI is hidden gem . compare circulating supply with $SOL 
with their coin-phone is scam!
Wow most of the shitcoins are scamsshit
Wow, why r they having so many problems now?  Can they fix all of the bugs? Very sketchy, stay away, I feel terrible for all the ppl that bought in at $140+ 
you know it is time to buy when so many people are bearish
You should not fall into the whale trap, because the world's economic situation is not good until the end of this year. Don't be lulled by the btc chart, because at any time btc will fall very deep
you will tell you kids one day that you missed buying SOL at 30
chart weekly on bearish
No one who is keen on crypto should ever miss out on the chance to participate in this innovatory product

BTC  $ETH  $DOT  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE   Tesla(Elon) dumped 75% of his BTC worth of 936 million US Dollar. Why you say? Because they know the crash will come sooner or later.
BTC  People will be mad salty when they realize this was a typical bear market rally and we are merely at the midway point of downward movement. Think logically. If the bear market is over, this will be historically the shortest, fastest bear market in history at a time when things have never been worse on the global stage. Limit the liquidity you provide for the manipulators and keep some dry powder on the side. $ADA  $XRP  $ETH  $SOL  $DOT  $DOGE  $QNT
Bullish for development, bearish for the price.
is a ghost chain
it will drop after fed
not really concerned i bought first coins about 2 years ago dca every month and hodl untill such time as i am ready to sell but i feel a bit bearish at moment becsuse of fluctuation in price but long term who knows whats going to happen slow and steady wins the race 
so glad I got out at the high. moved on
I've been closely following it and I'm happy to be early.
this coin is done....ada will be able soon to run avax apps through virtual machines. And not only avax but solana and ethereum dapps as well...it will kill them all 6 months after vasil hardfork this july
will be as luna
will dissapear after ada implements avax virtual machines
am still bearish on BNB bcus I bought at 450$ b4 the general crypto  crash and coming up gradually now. I hope it gets to #1000$ soon.
be careful fake pump then hard dump
I didbt expect this bearish outcome for now at all 
pump hard dump harder
$ETH  $USDT   The current rise is just some false and unconfirmed news. There is no good news. The bookmaker has taken advantage of this. The price should fall and some bad funds should be cleared out, so that eth can better meet the rise! 1. Inflation. 2. U.S. dollar rate hike
@indodax has been doing maintenance since yesterday until now. All transactions are closed. I suspect something is wrong in indodax's internals. 
All i need is BTC to hit 10K and i can buy a whole coin. And it will, eventually even if it pumped back to 25K first. Some say 8K or below so we shall see.
All those revenge gamblers who buy more and more. (D.C.A.-ing) Getting deeper and deeper into debt. And at some point they break, and will start selling !!! What will be the beginning of a rapid BTC crash.
be careful fake pump then hard dump
be careful please 
Bear flag in a bear flag?
Better not to predict
BIG SELL OFF INCOMING SOON  14K TO 10K WILL BE BOTTOM

Correction isn't over yet, still waiting until we hit below 7k by autumn.
CPI rally complete, dip beginning 9:30 Buckle up 
dead-cat bounce
did not break the 23k level and we in a bearish flag, so downside next to about 20.7k then after that to about 18 to 17.5k then even below that as we got to make lower lows still unfortunately. 
did you notice Bitcoin following ETH yesterday and it will again today. We donËÑå need Bitcoin as king anymore. It‰è≠ too bipolar and will always drag down the market. Let‰è≠ crown a new king and the time is now. $BTC $ETH $ADA $SOL
distribution zone, dump is coming. 
don't be fooled guys...it"s a the trap,the  newcomers have no idea...they've just seen the small profits and talk firmly about the big future and the moon shit...just stay calm and wait for the drop then buy step by step...È¥Ç
down we go
ETH  $BTC  Sell now before the whales dump. Dont FOMO and wait
Fake Bullish Confirm $17K July Dump. USA recession 
Fake pump by the whales. Sell now before the whales dump it.
fake pumping in all markets
FOMO and FUD , the psychology trick used to whale advantage
get ready for the bear in next week.
Go learn economics. You'll see why this time it's different.
going down.  sideways till sept
Guys please stop your FOMO, we are in a bear market, you will keep losing, is looking so bad for you moon boys
Here is a look at the DXY. Slowly going up. This does not for sure mean the rally is over, but if the DXY keeps moving up, that is not good news for Crypto.
hodl is the biggest scam.
I have never been through any kind of bear market. I got involved in crypto in January of 2021. Ive never been through an actual relief rally because this bear market is so bad. Everything you learn in this bear market will help you so much when the next bull market starts.
I love #Bitcoin as much as the rest of you guys but Bitcoin is not a Hedge against inflation it is nothing more than a speculative asset just like stocks,precious metals, or any other speculative asset its nothing more than that no matter what these dumbass Bitcoin maxis say
i think it is going under 15k
I told you all that BTC is going down to hell and youËÄ±l thought it a joke... DonËÑå fall for the ant hill been made by whales these season
I'm bearish in the short term ( 6 - 12 months) and Very Bullish long-term, 12 - 24 months Bitcoin will be $100,000 plus
Inflation increase, wonna buy, will buy with 5K
is the biggest shitcoin ever
it may likely drop because of the shooting star 
its go to 16k after to 40ksell btc now
Last pump before big dump!
lets just get too $14k so we cant start coming back up again
Liquidate shorter at the top of the range at 26k and go to 18k 
long live communism, long live the centralization of power.  Bitcoin and decentralization are dead.  Rich, millionaires and billionaires, donate all your bitcoins to the state/government. 
lower lows coming
Macro factors are too much to overcome. I'm bearish in the short-term and bullish in the long-term 
manipulation at work.. 80% of coins are centralised no   doubt. it's unfortunate 
may drop a leg down
New issue the FED USA Tappering and bearflag. USA Recession, Warning!!!
Pay attention guys to the big bankers they know what's up JP Morgan just said more storm clouds ahead for financial markets and this guy is a believer in #Bitcoin 
ponzi scheme still attracts more idiots every day 
Sell for safe, US Inflation increase 9.1% very high risk
similar of jun 2022 it was price in 29k than bullish in 31k then bearish in 20k IËÅî thinking it‰è≠ game from 20k to 22 k then bearish in 15k at soon 
soon fed rise interest 
stay down bitcoin. do not go up
still 10k to 16k incoming this pump was a bull trap plus crypto won't rebound until the traditional markets rebound that's a fact cryptos follow the Nasdaq fact
synchronized bull traps repeating
take your profits and leave before the dump
the sad reality is that the whales are trading promises for profit. this is how the Bitcoin scam works, they tell you to buy and hold in the promise that the coin gonna pump, and at this lower levels, the do series of small pumps and whenever the ...
The yellow circle was today. We are halfway up to the top of the channel we have been making for over a month now. If that is bullish I feel sorry for you all.
there‰è≠ no way this bullish trend will last for long it will have to reach the 200MA maybe breach it a bit but will go down again. this is my honest opinion :)
this pump is exit liquidity for whales before a dump
this pump will not last, perhaps, a global economic shock is incoming ... Brace yourselves, folks!
This rise is only temp... slow your DCA
watch out for that first step, its a doozie
BB RSI and MACD at 1h on Coinbase look like we might be headed for a bearish turn. Keep an eye on it.
BTC  People will be mad salty when they realize this was a typical bear market rally and we are merely at the midway point of downward movement. Think logically. If the bear market is over, this will be historically the shortest, fastest bear market in history at a time when things have never been worse on the global stage. Limit the liquidity you provide for the manipulators and keep some dry powder on the side. $ADA  $XRP  $ETH  $SOL  $DOT  $DOGE  $QNT
Come on Elon, I thought you had the midas touch, promoting this shitcoin, did as well as your fake rockets. Clown
I invested at $.25 and now it's at 06 and it dosen't look like comin up anytime soon
is trash. $TSUKA IS NEXT 100000x
not doing anything
SHIB hype driven shitcoin. It will die this crypto winter. There's not enough room for 2 dogs. $DOGE has the position. 
BTC  $ETH  $XRP  $MATIC  $SOL  $DOT  Dont invest you will for sure get caught in a bulltrap. Control your FOMO and save your money now and invest later.

it's time to left dot just sacmmer coin
- Bull Trap of the Century!
$BTC  Sell now before the whales dump. Dont FOMO and wait
+1000 is not a moon. 2 year bear market
150K Bitcoin from Mt Gox going to dump in market in August, FOMC next week. Good luck buying in FOMO.
at least one last dump before finally going to the moon 
Ayo, looks like ETH did some short liquidation RIP
Bearish to the max  1. Recession at the door  2. Heat wave - gpu miners going off  3. FED  4. Speculation: They are gonna delay the merge, I'm sure about it. There are still some ASIC miners that need to be repayed.
BTC  $ETH  $DOT  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE   Tesla(Elon) dumped 75% of his BTC worth of 936 million US Dollar. Why you say? Because they know the crash will come sooner or later.

BTC $ETH big pump always before a crash happens dont invest dont FOMO we are still in a bearmarket 
BTC $ETH relief rally over. dump is coming 
BTC bitcoin can be pumped up to a million dollar then next day will drop to zero the misery is all alt coins are linked to it $ETH $BNB $ADA $SOL $XRP 
Climbed way too fast, even for Crypto standards. I think people are worried that they might miss out while it pumps.  Fed raising basis points and recession looming, people need funds to buy gas and food, etc.  I see a recalibration near $1000-$1100 in the next 10 days. 
dead cat bounce it is.
Def bearish from here.
Don¬°¬¶t be too excited guys, a huge dump is in view...
Ethereum and the whole crypto-market still has not seen bottom. You cannot enter a bull market in a recession, with both debt and inflation still rising and exceeding expectations in a negative direction. The math doesn't add up.
fake pump after a massive dump
fake pump, drop soon
Fake rumors are being spread across multiple platforms that a MEGA ETH whale is in the market. This is simply not true and the current market sentiment is bearish.
fed soon. bearish.
feeling nervous about it now
I hope you have sold. Let's go to 800 - 1000
i sold @1350 wait another dip 1000 to buy again 
i would say it is a fake pump, be really careful. There is no reason for rising.
I¬°¬¶m bearish didn¬°¬¶t swap on time
I¬°¬¶m bearish on$ETH 
if this pump is real  $ETH  will keep going and I¬°¬¶ll buy when it¬°¬¶s real. manipulation at its finest in crypto and it sucks. 
Ignorant exchanges do such things to destroy ordinary people by taking money from weak people. Shame on these exchanges.
im long at 1150
inflation was higher than expected (9.1%).
is definitely overpriced at the moment.  In just a short period of time it gained more than 50% back... It can't rise more than other coins cuz if so the whales who bought below 1 000$  will dump the price
it's a trap. be careful $BTC $ETH $XRP
Last pump waiting for a dump again !
Last pump waiting for a dump again !
lets get down letz get down
next week Eth will bottom at 700
Now will go down! Mark my words. 
'Now will happen bear like never before. Just watch!
perfect time to open short position, fake pump, dump incoming. Back to 1000
probably last pump before biggest dump. There is literally no reason for a pump. Its all manipulation.
pump hard dump harder 
risk!  can't go more it will down..
SCAM. Will go to 0
Soon will dump. Be Careful 
still can test the support area, be careful and don't get caught the FOMO.
still have any doubts it down back to 800-1000$ next days? ok, let's see :)
The chart doesnt look right to me, it hasn't since 13th July when it bounced off $1006. I don't call anything 'fake' and the break above $1283 suprised me but yesterdays $1424 resulted from a short squeeze and to me it has all the appearance of big money sniffing for liquidity. It might still push a bit higher but I'll still be holding onto my shorts. (metaphorically and literally...lol ;)
this us going to sell off heavily. eth moved too quickly to sustain this price. sell while you can. the fed rate hike will be bad and it's going to make eth drop again. bearish af.
Trust me this is a bulltrap... Wait untill 800-1000 range... Retailers FOMOing rn and getting rekt next week by the whales...
watch what happens around Wednesday morning!!! The FED is Meeting again and expected to raise the Interest rates 75 more points!!!  Another big Dump is Inevitable 
we are going to see another dump, I will advise you to sell and make profit, then buy when it dump.. it did it yesterday and bought this morning.. 
we need to get it down so we can buy
we should see this fall back to the bottom slope.
why buy it now when I can buy it for 600 after earnings season?
will crash 25-30% more in the coming week(s). Will recover slowly after. Very slowly..
will go down to 800$ easily before to the moon. 
A and $LUNC seem to be converging: to $0. 
A do kwon scammer we are not going to buy $LUNA  until $LUNC gets its value back 
A there are far better coins and tokens to invest in.. especially after how they left ppl in the dust when $LUNC and $USTC  collapsed.. I bet that lot of ppl invested in this just BCS of the low price and a hope that this too will moon like $LUNC did 
A this is not the right Luna $LUNC 
fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.
had to go to therapy over the fact I live in a world of morons and idiots who buy into the same very exact fing thing that took people's money in the first place. You holders should look up the definition of insanity. 
HEX is like $LUNC $UST but for rednecks 
it's a dream city here. Wake up and see the facts.
JUST A WASTE OF TIME, PRICE HAS STALLED BECAUSE WHALES ARE CONSTANTLY FARMING 
knowing this, it‰è≠ difficult to argue that $LUNC canËÑå 1000x+ all earth assets.
make no mistake, until you unlink luna from the USTC, this coin will only drain your money
man, I had such high hopes that this would fly, but it‰è≠ walking instead. Well, hopefully, we can reach our destination within a year or two. Idk
REDLUNA  scam copy 
Stop deleting my opinion. It's a trash project. CEO and team stole money from people. It's oficials news. You don't like the truth? They stole from you, pooled out money and live their best life. Look at 3 month chart. It went down 10000%. I would never trust again.
THIS CRAP NOT GOING ANYWHERE 
This thing is struggling to reach 1 billion market cap,  in comparison to the 41  billion it once saw. I don't know why it's trending nor what ppl are seeing in this.
When this project crush I lost a lot of money but I'm okay, I understand this is crypto. and now it's like a Meme coin no solid back up plan at all. So I switch to  $VVS  $SOLAR  $CORE  $SOLO  & $DARK  . Tell me you don't care..... I know! È¥Ç
BTC  $ETH  $DOT  $SOL  $ADA  $DOGE   Tesla(Elon) dumped 75% of his BTC worth of 936 million US Dollar. Why you say? Because they know the crash will come sooner or later.

bull trap soon, $20 soon 
centralized + SEC lawsuit + outage + bad tokenomics + no supply cap  idk why people buy this shitcoin i perfer avax atleast it dosn't have $SOL problems  bearish this project is soluna
dead cat bounce.
dump it. bad news coming for solana. don't say I didn't warn you. 
ETH $SOL $BTC thank you all for this exit liquidity . good luck see you in 22 days 
going to below 35 within a week
hort bearish mode incoming 
how is this 9 to 5 blockchain this highly priced?  What lunatics are investing in this project?
I am doing stking ! But Sol will back to 36 next 24 hrs
I am going to invest in it as I saw a huge popularity.
Ignorant exchanges do such things to destroy ordinary people by taking money from weak people. Shame on these exchanges.
is it gonna go down than $30
My attitude to  is distinct and concrete: the product is good-quality and very original.
passed the EMA 55 and Ichimoku Conversion Line Cross Base Line.MACD is crossed allready so bearish will follow
SCAM!!! Worst L1 ever!!
SCAM!!!! Worst L1 EVER!!!
shorting for the night
Solana will dissapear soon
still too expensive
This whole thing looks kind of sudden because nothing special happened recently. IÀáve got some mixed feelings honestly. 
wanted to load my bags with SOL this bear market, however painful development on SOL and blockchain outages convinced me not to and to choose better alternatives out there..
worse crypto chain and idea but sadly hugely supported by many rich people, and chain crashes all the time 
you canÀát ask a shark to fly 
be careful fake pump then hard dump
I choose and confide in this project as well!
I recommend not to avoid this one, it will blow your mind!
I was so happy that I eventually found this project!
SCAM, WILL CRASH WITH USDD
the global economic crisis is still going on and will continue for some years later
be careful fake pump then hard dump
BTC  People will be mad salty when they realize this was a typical bear market rally and we are merely at the midway point of downward movement. Think logically.

Limit the liquidity you provide for the manipulators and keep some dry powder on the side. $ADA  $XRP  $ETH  $SOL  $DOT  $DOGE  $QNT
down to bottom soon
I am getting tired of holding this.
I believe will pop between December and February just stacking my bags
it's a trap. be careful $BTC $ETH 
it‰è≠ about time to book some profits as the bulls getting weaker.
scam, 0,01$ coming soon. developer donkey. 
will drop further in the next couple months, but long-term will appreciate, regardless of the outcome with the SEC. Too much global adoption already. Short-term bearish, long-term bullish.
ETH going to lose a massive amount traffic to $ADA. 
going to collapse till 0,23 and below
has too much supply can not go much higher 
I will look for a buy around 2025~30
is a meme shitcoin... it is about future and promises while other (AVAX, COSMO, DOT) are shipping everyday and performing much better
looks like bearish
The OG of the shitcoins
This phase is known as the "dead cat bounce" and also "the sucker's rally".  You will all get crushed.  $ADS will be at .40 or lower by the end of the year and lower going into 2023.  Hear me now and believe me later.
We want a slow climb.... not a pump and dump 
will fail after Vasil sees no effect
Yeah its crashing!
Am I only seeing a bear? 
centralized trashcoin...stick to ada
if you have to choose between filling your gas tank or buying Avax, you know it is an easy choice 
is going to vanish by 2023
still hope will boom soon
hope its more bearish to buy 
How easily they manipulate and steal our money
 in here the whale doesn't want to buy a lot of bitcoins, some are waiting at the price of 12k 
$BTC $WAM $ETH will remain after this bear 
$eth big crash the week end waiting the announcement of FED tuesday sell BTC now  (ETH no will have less crash before a big pump in september) 
agent BTC 007 : not time to buy 
all those who were bullish, nice hopium u had. literally can't sit down with the straight facts we threw right on ur face. Bears will win this market cycle.
Another signal for bear. 
DO NOT BUY CRYPTO! 
due to inflation is still existing.
Fed News by Next Week. Bullish.
here the downfall comes
How low will she fall? Dipping below 30 on RSI at 1h.
i can taste that interest rate hike all ready.
I hope and think FED will send BTC below 17k. I want to buy much more 
If this month BTC go 19k and more down its not good. The good scenario is to do one last retest in 22k meaby 19800k and go up after 
is bearish in weekly chart
it seems going down
It will crash further down. 
keep your cash until 14k
looking to break the $22k resistance and go below very bearish now 
Moonboys all hot and bothered over FED day..they think they will get the bounce to new ATH. You fools are delusional you are all going to go broke. Its Ok ill be there to buy your panic sold worthless bags when BTC is like 5K in October. New ATH may never be seen again, 30K will be a struggle. BTC is done, the world has lost faith in it
-MOST URGENT BTC is crashing to 18k tonite. Tesla sold remaining BTCs.
no support at 20K bulls get rekked
Oh no! Fake pump all along!
okay everybody so it's time for what we all know happens every weekend. the Bitcoin weekend pump and dump! it'll start pumping tomorrow and it will dump on late Sunday like it has for the last two and a half to three years. make sure you put your stop orders in!
Pitiful, Cant even sustain a small rally
ready to time asia  Big Crash Coming
Slow rug pull.
sorry kids, bullish sign is gone (short term) we are looking at btc between the ranges of 19k-21k. It‰è≠ very possible for this to change (FOMC meeting) could go to lows of 16k or upwards to $26k
Target is 6000 dollar as started pump in Mar 2020 , u must know everytime price is back to start pump price
the market not have any reason for other bullrun in this year. Global economy in crash, halving only in 2024, the BTC only went up because the PoS speculation about eth. 
this is where it goes off the cliff
Waiting on FOMC results to come in 27-28th and Stock earnings to shed some light on where $BTC could dump/pump to. Bearish short term on $QNT, we could see it drop lower than previous lows of 40 and oscillate between that and 100 this bear market before any take off. DCA wisely. 
We are finding resistance on our dump line from the previous dump. If we canËÑå break above this line and hold it, a dump to the downside is increasingly likely.
Weekly chart. Lower highs, lower lows. Expect more of the same. Case dismissed.
well I remember buying btc at 3.5k USD where no one wanted it. I think 20k is what has been 6k for a while back then, 20k is a psychological barrier as well, but i think it will drop even below 10k with some headlines 
where are all the retards and moonboys saying Bitcoin will hit ATH soon? Last days were an authentic circus of clowns. You understand sh*t.
will go down
Will it break below 20K today?
you can always short bitcoin, cool
Dode has 8b market cap and Syscoin is at 100m ? crypto is a joke i swear
doge is going down
This coin should not exist. Maybe one of the biggest ponzi scheme  in crypto world. I'm sorry for people trust money. !
trash meme coin die finally
I am selling all my Dot, will buy back once it will reach $2.5
i think it will test the 4,85 USD resistance zone but i beleive it can go bullish in a further future because this is a greay project
Stupid team. They do not communicate with the community, reschedule meetings 2 hours before the start.  Coins are not redeemed, there are no volumes
wait and watch it will come down to $3.5
: 40% of the holders of ETH are longterm investors, or have large stackings or are hodl-ers. However, the merge will release 13 milion ETH, will it be sold or stacked again, but that depend on the fees and on the way its financed (leverage). The SEC will be going after the exchanges and DeFi. ETH and ADA are big, because of stacking.
: ETH will go up again, if the macro conditions will improve. See it form this perspective: ETH had al ATH price of 4750 dollars. If you buy ETH at 1400 dollars, it is possible that the price could drop by 50% to 700 dollars, but in a bullmarket it will increase tot at least 5000 dollars, an 350% rise in price. This is a low risk, high benefit position. Buy small, do not go in, all at once.
a typical pump and dump scheme, they take your money for electrronic money that you cant touch  you cant touch  no sense
again massive fake pump 
ahaha some salty kids reporting my post Bruhh his thing is dead 
bad news coming guys from the PRE-FED that means the stock market is going into the red
bearish on eth dumped at 1600 looking to buy back in at 800-900 if you think differently your parents are siblings
bearish signals. if you are bullish this week, don¬°¬¶t blame the market when it drains your portfolio.
Bearish so incogneto the basement Dweller comments
BOOM!!  there it is wait dont buy right now lower lows 
BTC  follow $ETH  now. We don¬°¬¶t need Bitcoin anymore and Ethereum is much more stable.
BTC $ETH whales manipulating the market again to steal your money
btc is going to take another leg down and is closing the week in red. everything goes with btc, eth will not be able to sustain these levels of gains and will have to consolidate lower. 
buying after fed announcement, too risky today
check my last post, more dip coming.. if you sold yesterday like I did, get ready to buy the dip..
classic bull trap 
crashing to 500$ than it will be  worth to buy :)
crypto crash This Week end until the FED announcement This tuesday ( ETH no must bleed so much before a biiiiiig pump to the moon in september with the merge and the stabilization of inflation) 
dang, $ETH just did over 2% dip within about a minute 
Developers making money out of announcements on twitter only to delay again each time they make millions while you poor people buy in to the hype. 
Dip is not yet done done listen to people saying buy and hold they are negative PNL they just want you to help redeem their high entry buy making you buy
don't get caught in the bull trap the market isn't ready for this movement wait a little
down, down  see you at 1060 next week.  invest smart ! 
dumping whilst I¬°¬¶m dumping
enjoying the ride to the bottom
Ethereum developers etc made their money from this news announcement and will leave everyone in the dust only to delay again literally making money out of Twitter posts.
from here on till after tommorrows news the selling will begin carefull
get down to 1450
get out as soon as possible and buy back in @ 1300
going down!!!!!!
going down, the joyride is over
going to 1k again for sure
going to lose a massive amount traffic to $ADA. 
have you wonder how stupid sounds to buy a currency, lose money in fees, to pay for the same things that you was going to buy with your paypal account in dollars  to solve this issue, ethereum made smartcontracts, so you take your dollars, and buy ethereum, to pay the fees, for the second currency in smart contracts that you buy  so if you have 100 dollars, get ethereum and any other smartcontract currency, and you will have 97 dollars or maybe less, according to the smartcontract and gwei fees  haha
hope it dumps so I can get discount
I dont follow the "hype"...we wait
i fear an insane dump is coming..
I lost my hand and left....I am so sad and upset. I broke my monitor...I don't know why the market is crashing, I was so hot that I broke it...I lost my mind and lost my mind... Calm down now...it's so embarrassing... $BTC  
I think Ethereum will go back down to touch the final bottom and rocket up for the September Merge..
if btc down,eth double down!!!
If i buy, it will be between 750-1000 dollar. The macro economic situation is pretty bad. If the FED increases de interest rate with 100 bp, the cost of borrowing will increase dramatically. And quantative tighting is failling. The FED is making a loss of 500 billion dollars this year, and the loss will be transferend to de federal State. The taxpayer is going to pay for saving the banks, the expensive cars etc.
If you are bullish right now, I heard Mac Donald¬°¬¶s is hiring bros that are down bad.
If you are buying now like I mentioned before, y'all going to get fckd in the a$$ without lube. DACing is the way! Sub 500 bucks incoming after merge.
it seems the bull has been slaughtered by the bear
it will bearish the price is really heavy now,, this pump is a last pump of this months,, believe or not that's will happen soon
it will drop to $1470 so it can pump even harder again
it¬°¬¶s falling in abyss now 
Just another pump and dump. I sold everything and will buy back when the dump has arrived. U guys don't know how a bear market works, this is just FOMO and Scam from the whales. Don't get caught holding the bag. 
Just some thoughts for the CMC community... I'd be the LAST person to ever give out finacial advice hahaha so this certainly isn't... but I think stacking cash for your next ETH buy would be wise. I think a big crash is coming sub 1,000. Could be wrong! but man, what an oppertunity that would be! Almost doubling your buys from its current price point. Time will tell!
my intellect tells me bearish
old technology. New advanced and improved L1 blockchain technology on it's way and that's Pulsechain. A hard fork of Ethereum with a copy of the full system state. The biggest airdrop in crypto space. All the ERC20 in your wallet you get a exact copy on Pulsechain. I expect the Pulsechain launch within 7 months.
only bears insight, unless interest rates start dropping. 
people i don¬°¬¶t understand why you don¬°¬¶t do some research, the last beae cycle eth dropped 94% , do your calculations this bear market is more terrible then ever war , inflation the biggest, global economy in crisis, so 94% drop as the 2018 bear cycles means 200-400$ etherum 
recession soon down to $700
resistance at 1600 lets see if it breaks it 
same here, I¬°¬¶m bearish on 
scam pump get out now
see you at 550 you useless piece of coin
sell all your Ethereum now, or pay the ultimate price
send it to hell, bear signal was given. very clear. 1200-1300 price range is what I¬°¬¶m looking for. potentially $800-$900 with FOMC and stock market FUD
short term bearish  just Took profit , gonna dip wait and buy at lower levels 
sinking like I said a week ago ;)
Sold 50% of my $ETH  at 1600USD. If it goes down... good, i will rebuy around 1000USD. If it goes up... good anyway. And i will use the USDT to invest in other blue chips. I love this market cause it gives us new opportunities every single day.
still going down 
temp pump, wait for tomorrows growth news to show we are in a recession when it tanks. ETH reached this level last week 
that is true you can purchase on it now

rubbish token , going nowhere 
this crap is nothing more than a pump n dump now 
this is way too funny to watch everyone having high hopes in a coin that is past dead. This absolute trash is already decayed and turned into dust and still people are saying it will hit 0,1 or 1
this lunc is shit
This people want to scam us again
will never go up, wake up guys 
you are all crazy. here in LUNC there are two types of investors. -those who bought high and now have lost everything -those who bought very, very cheap and who will never win anything. a great vicious circle closed. all run like puppies around the tail
always dumps harder than other crypto. shitcoin
Better invest in Avax
bull trap bull trap bull trap. sideways for a very very long time new 52 lows to come.
get ready for the crash... 15B market cap... the fall will be hard.. it will go below $18
going to below 35 within a week
hort bearish mode incoming 
I think another accumulation phase is overdue.. as well as a retesting of previous lows, this would be a preference for many; to allow confidence in buying and to FOMO in some bullish movement! We shall see soon enough what BlackRock & The U.S. FED have in store for us..
insecure and not scalable, it will vanish by next year
never catch falling knife
shorting for the night
such a bad project, 7 downtimes,  lying about supply several times, very centralized and self orientated token distribution and not secure at all. Everyone that knows about blockchains stays aways from Solana they work on a phone now instead of fixing their broken chain.
The worst blockchain ever, in the top 10,  How ironic.
worst blockchain, it can't scale, insecure...doomed to failure
definitely a stable coin 
fake pump. Will go back to .04
going to collapse one day suddenly
I guess the whole crypto market is going down more and more nothing positive 
a bad week for crypto, bonds and stocks.
it won't survive the court case 
peoples are just waiting for the sec case to be over so they can sell after the pump....this coin has no utility and it will fall after that event
shit coin $MDT is far far better than this
the bottom of price of this coin is unidentified yet, so it'll go lower. I am absolutely sure
